# Farmland Segmentation

**APEM: An Adaptive Prior-Enhanced Model for Language-Driven Remote Sensing Farmland Segmentation**

This is a multimodal farmland segmentation model based on the Swin-V2-B backbone, Agriculture-BERT text encoder, Mamba global modeling, local self-attention and cross-modal attention, and attention-guided adaptive fusion. The model features a specially designed boundary enhancement branch to further improve edge accuracy.

### Performance (on the FarmSeg-VL dataset)

- Test Set IoU: ~88.92
